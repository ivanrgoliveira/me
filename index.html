                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>I'm a self taught developer who's passionate about building things (anything really) the right way
                    with a passion for best practices and clean/readable code.<br>
                    I have experience leading teams, mentoring and guiding development to follow best practices, reusability
                    and, most importantly, performant and bug-free code. I'm a fan of continuous-delivery and continuous-integration!<br>
                    My professional success is a testament to my work ethic, willingness to adapt in the fast paced world of development and my attention to detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before coming to London I had 8 years of experience as a multifaceted developer in Braga, Portugal. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a person I'm very focused, ambitious and always up for a challenge.<br>
                    I like to get things done quickly but never taking shortcuts, it may sound contraditory but I also love process.
                    Without process there is no organization and I love organized things.
