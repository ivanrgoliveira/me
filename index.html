                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>I'm a self-taught developer who's passionate about building things the right way with a special interest
                    in knowing what best practices are and an advocate for clean/reusable code.
                </p>
                <p>I have experience leading teams, coaching and guiding development to follow best practices,
                    reusability and, most importantly, performant and bug-free code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm very adaptable, always a team player and love to play with new technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before moving to London I had 8 years of experience as a multifaceted developer in Braga, Portugal.

                    <p>As the Lead Frontend Developer for Debut I was tasked with delivering business critical projects with tight deadlines while maintaining a high code quality standard.
