                <h2>Profile</h2>
                <p>I'm a self-taught developer who's passionate about building things the right way with a special interest
                    in knowing what best practices are and an advocate for clean/reusable code.
                    <br />I have experience leading teams, coaching and guiding development to (try to) follow best practices,
                    reusability and, most importantly, performant and bug-free code.
                    <br />I'm a big fan of CD/CI, fast iterations and high cadence of releases.
                    <br />My professional success is a testament to my work ethic and willingness to adapt in the fast-paced world of development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before moving to London I had 8 years of experience as a multifaceted developer in Braga, Portugal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm very focused, ambitious and always up for a challenge.

                    <h3>Lead Frontend Developer</h3>
                    <h4>Debut | Septmber 2018 - Present</h4>
                    <p>
                        Debut is the world’s first careers app dedicated to students and graduates.
                        <br />Debut is a completely free app for students to showcase their profile and skills in an engaging and fun way to employers across the country. 
                        For graduate employers, it is the attraction tool of choice, providing them unprecedented targeting and access to a wide and receptive talent pool.
                    </p>
                    <p>As the Lead Frontend Developer for Debut my role involves working in very distinct projects ranging from a <a href="https://jobs.debut.careers">jobs board</a> (https://jobs.debut.careers), 
                        to develop a gateway for the frontend projects, to rebuilding and repurpose the internal admin tool to be ready for commercial use and also allows me to work
                        on projects that aren't frontend related (eg. Deeplinks microservice for the Web products using NestJS).
                        <br />I've also created the CD/CI process for all frontend projects using GAE Flex/GKE, Google Cloud Build and Google Cloud Functions; 
                        manage contractors (design, frontend devs, external companies) and liaise with Product Managers (early development, grooming features, etc).
